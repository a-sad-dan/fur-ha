            strength in the quiet moments. Just like I looked after my folks and aimed high, I see that same spark in
            you. Life's full of twists, but no matter where it takes you, remember this: you're loved, just the way you
            are. Like a ninja with a heart of gold, I promise you, through thick and thin, you've got a friend who's got
            your back. So go on, chase those dreams, tackle those hurdles â€“ I'm here, cheering you on every step. You're
            never alone on this journey. Here's to being incredible, here's to being cherished, and here's to a bond
            that's as strong as ninja steel. Take care, Farha, and know that you're always held close."</p>
